\title{Generate an H3 Hexagonal Grid for an sf Object}
\usage{
get_h3_grid(sf_object, resolution = 6, expand_factor = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{sf_object}{(\code{sf}) An sf object defining the area of interest.
Must have a valid coordinate reference system (CRS).}

\item{resolution}{(\code{integer}) H3 resolution level (1â€“16). Default is 6.
Lower values produce fewer, larger hexagons (faster processing, coarser grid).}

\item{expand_factor}{(\code{numeric}) Expands bounding box to ensure coverage.
Default is 0.1.}
}
\value{
(\code{sf}) An sf object containing the hexagonal grid polygons
  covering the input area. Each polygon represents an H3 cell at the specified
  resolution, with a column containing the H3 index.
}
\description{
Generates a hexagonal grid of H3 cells at a specified resolution
that intersect with a given `sf` object. This is a wrapper for
functions from the \pkg{h3jsr} package.
}
\details{
Reducing the resolution (e.g., 5 or 6) can greatly reduce processing time and memory
usage, especially for large AOIs. Each decrease in resolution increases the size of
individual hexagons exponentially.

\examples{
\donttest{
library(sf)
nc <- st_read(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package="sf"))
h3_grid_sf <- get_h3_grid(nc, resolution = 6)
