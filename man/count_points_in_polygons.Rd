\title{Count Points within Polygons}
\usage{
count_points_in_polygons(points_sf, polygons_sf)
}
\arguments{
\item{points_sf}{An sf object representing point geometries.}

\item{polygons_sf}{An sf object representing polygon geometries.}
}
\value{
An sf polygon object with an additional column `point_count` representing the number of points within each polygon.
}
\description{
This function takes an sf point object and an sf polygon object,
counts the number of points within each polygon, and returns
the polygon sf object with an additional column containing
the count of points.
}
